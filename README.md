# favorite-cmd-commands
## ls
It is one of the easiest commands in CLI. It show the names of the files and folders. It is realy simple but probably my favorite command because of how helpful it sometimes is. **pwd** is also very useful in that regard.

## touch and mkdir commands
We use touch for creating files, and mkdir for creating folders. There are also some commands that can be helpful in this regard, like **rm** and **rmdir**. **rm** delete af file and **rmdir** delete af folder.

## git command
I am really starting to like **git**. I think it is a wonderful tool to use when bulding a projekt. There are many **git** related commands like **git add** where you add a file to index or **git status** where you check the status of working tree. There is also **git commit** where you commit changes in index and **git branch** where you add a new branch. There also many more **git** related commands like **git clone**, **git reset** and many others.
